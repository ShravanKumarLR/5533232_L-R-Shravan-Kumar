\# Git Practice Repository



\## Description



This repository is created as part of my learning journey in mastering Git and GitHub.  

It serves as a personal workspace to practice essential Git commands, version control workflows, and collaborative development techniques.



The goal is to become comfortable with:

\- Initializing and cloning repositories

\- Committing and pushing changes

\- Branching, merging, and conflict resolution

\- Managing project files using Git



\## Repository Structure



\- `README.md` â€” Project overview and documentation

\- `hello.txt`, `test.txt`, etc. â€” Practice files for Git commands

\- Additional branches for testing and experimentation
